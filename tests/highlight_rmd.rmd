title: Test document for highlighting rmd documents
---

This purpose of this file is to test highlighting of R markdown documents that
optionally contain chunk labels and chunk options for processing with the knitr
R package.

The following examples are taken from Yihuis [knitr options
page](https://yihui.org/knitr/options/) as per end of July 2022.

Currently, the chunk label `my-chunk` in the following example is highlighted
as R code, i.e. the hyphen `-` is highlighted as R operator, although dashes
are [explicitly](https://yihui.org/knitr/options/#chunk-options) and even
[strongly](https://bookdown.org/yihui/rmarkdown/r-code.html) recommended for
chunk labels as opposed to underscores.

```{r, my-chunk, echo=FALSE, fig.height=4, dev='jpeg'}
```

The following alternative form does not suffer from this.

```{r, label='my-chunk'}
```

The following alternative to specify chunk labels is simply highlighted as an R
comment.

```{r}
#| my-chunk, echo = FALSE, fig.width = 10,
#| fig.cap = "This is a long long
#|   long long caption."

plot(cars)
```

When chunk options are specified in yaml syntax, options and their values are
highlighted differently.

```{r}
#| echo: false
#| fig.width: 10
```
