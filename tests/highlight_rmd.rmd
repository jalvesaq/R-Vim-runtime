title: Test document for highlighting rmd documents
---

This purpose of this file is to test highlighting of R markdown documents that
optionally contain chunk labels and chunk options for processing with the knitr
R package.

The following examples are taken from Yihuis [knitr options
page](https://yihui.org/knitr/options/) as per end of July 2022, and were extended
to cover some more use cases.

Note that hyphens are
[explicitly](https://yihui.org/knitr/options/#chunk-options) and even
[strongly](https://bookdown.org/yihui/rmarkdown/r-code.html) recommended for
chunk labels as opposed to e.g. underscores.

```{r, my-chunk-1, echo=FALSE, fig.height=4, dev='jpeg'}
```

In earlier times, there was no comma before the chunk label

```{r my-chunk-2, echo=FALSE, fig.height=4, dev='jpeg'}
```

and underscores were used in chunk labels. As underscores are now deprecated
for chunk labels because they may cause problems with the newer output formats
from the `bookdown` package, it makes sense not to include such chunk labels in
the highlighting of the chunk delimiter.

```{r my_old_chunk, echo=FALSE, fig.height=4, dev='jpeg'}
```

A chunk label can be specified without further options:

```{r, my-chunk-3}
```

The following alternative form of specifying a chunk label is also possible.

```{r, label='my-chunk'}
```

The following alternative to specify chunk options (and a label in this case)
is currently simply highlighted as an R comment.

```{r}
#| my-chunk, echo = FALSE, fig.width = 10,
#| fig.cap = "This is a long long
#|   long long caption."

plot(cars)
```

When chunk options are specified in yaml syntax, options and their values are
highlighted differently.

```{r}
#| echo: false
#| fig.width: 10
```

We also want to use some inline R code `r highlight=TRUE`.
